# RA-GeneRelief 🧬  
**AI-Powered Modeling for Rheumatoid Arthritis Gene Therapy**  
Ethics-compliant ML pipeline with CRF simulation, registry generation, and scientific documentation.

## 📁 Project Overview  
RA-GeneRelief simulates a clinical trial pipeline for rheumatoid arthritis using synthetic patient registries, visit-level CRFs, and gene therapy modeling. Built with reproducibility, ethics, and recruiter-readiness in mind.

## 🔬 Key Features  
- ✅ `registry_loader.ipynb`: Generates synthetic RA patient registry with consent status  
- ✅ `crf_simulation_restored.ipynb`: Simulates visit-level CRFs with dosage, symptoms, and ethics tracking  
- ✅ `ml_modeling.ipynb`: Predictive modeling for RA severity using scikit-learn  
- ✅ `gene_therapy_simulation.ipynb`: Exploratory simulation of gene therapy impact  
- ✅ Ethics statement and GCP-compliant documentation embedded

## 📦 Data Files  
- `notebooks/data/ra_registry.csv`: Synthetic patient registry  
- `notebooks/data/crf_simulated.csv`: Visit-level CRF entries

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- CRF simulation, ethics compliance, GCP literacy  
- GitHub repo structure, recruiter-facing documentation  
- Emotional resilience and repo restoration under pressure 💪
